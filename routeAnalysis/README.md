# Average Speed by Route
* In this approach, we analyze the dataset in order to obtain the average speed per route.
* We process the dataset ordered by time, simulating real time data.
* There are 15 possible routes.
* The result is that routes 1010 to 1020 and 1040 to 1060 are the most used ones.
* One example of the average speed in 1010 - 1020 route is the following:
